# Q1 

why is the "l" in `Long id` capitalized in the entity class? does it have something to do with wrapper classes? can you use a lowercase "l", as in `long id`?

# A1

In the entity class, the "L" in `Long id` is capitalized because `Long` is an object wrapper class for the primitive data type `long`. Similarly, `Integer`, `Double`, `Float`, etc., are wrapper classes for their corresponding primitive data types (`int`, `double`, `float`, etc.).

Using object wrapper classes allows you to use primitive data types in scenarios where objects are required. In the context of JPA (Java Persistence API) and Hibernate, using `Long` (wrapper class) instead of `long` (primitive data type) for the identifier (primary key) property is common practice.

When you use the wrapper class `Long`, it allows you to have a nullable primary key for the entity. By default, if you use `long id`, the primary key will be non-nullable, meaning it cannot be null. This can be problematic if you want to represent a database record that doesn't yet have an assigned ID (e.g., when the record is yet to be persisted).

Using `Long` allows you to represent an ID that may be null, indicating that the entity has not been persisted yet. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to distinguish between new (not yet persisted) and existing (already persisted) entities.

For example, with `Long id`:

```java
@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
private Long id; // ID can be null until the entity is persisted
```

With `long id`:

```java
@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
private long id; // ID cannot be null, may cause issues for new entities
```

Using `Long` instead of `long` also ensures that the entity's ID property can be set to `null` before it's persisted. In databases like MySQL, auto-incremented primary keys (such as `IDENTITY` strategy in JPA) will generate the ID value upon insertion, so a `null` value can be passed for the ID when saving a new entity, and the database will automatically assign a unique ID.

However, if you do need to use a primitive `long` for the primary key, you can do so. Just be mindful of the implications, and make sure it aligns with your application's requirements and database configuration.
