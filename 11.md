# Q1

does jpql do implicit type conversion

# A1

No, JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) does not perform implicit type conversion. When working with JPQL queries, you need to ensure that the types of your query parameters match the types of the entity attributes you are querying against.

If you attempt to compare or use mismatched types in your JPQL query, you may encounter errors. For example, if you have an attribute of type `Integer` in your entity and you try to compare it with a `String` in your JPQL query, you will likely get a type mismatch error.

It's important to explicitly cast or convert types in your JPQL queries to ensure correct and meaningful results. If you need to perform type conversion or manipulation within your query, you should use JPQL functions or expressions to achieve that.

Remember that JPQL is a statically typed language, and it closely resembles SQL in terms of querying syntax and behavior. This means that type compatibility is an important consideration when writing JPQL queries.

# Q2

how do you know jpql does not do implicit type conversion? mysql does implicit type conversion

# A2

I apologize for any confusion in my previous response. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) does support some level of implicit type conversion, but the extent of this support can depend on the JPA (Java Persistence API) implementation you are using, such as Hibernate or EclipseLink.

In JPQL, basic type conversions, such as converting numeric types, strings, and dates, are generally supported to some extent, similar to SQL. For example, you can compare different numeric types, concatenate strings and numbers, and perform basic arithmetic operations. However, the exact behavior might vary between different JPA providers.

It's important to refer to the documentation of the specific JPA implementation you are using to understand the level of implicit type conversion that is supported. Hibernate, for instance, might have different behavior compared to EclipseLink or other JPA providers.

Regarding MySQL, yes, MySQL's SQL dialect does support implicit type conversion in many cases. MySQL is known for its loose type conversion rules, where it can automatically convert values from one type to another in certain contexts.

If you are working with JPQL and JPA, I recommend referring to the documentation of your chosen JPA implementation (e.g., Hibernate, EclipseLink) for details on how type conversion is handled in queries. Additionally, testing your queries and observing the behavior can help you better understand how implicit type conversion works in your specific environment.
