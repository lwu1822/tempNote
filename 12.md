# Q1

i am using spring boot. my pojo looks like this:

`C.java`:
```
@Entity
@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
public class C {
    @Id 
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id; 

    private int d; 

    @Embedded
    private D f; 

    private int g;
}
```

my jpa repository file looks like this:
`CRepo.java`:
```
@Repository
public interface CRepo extends JpaRepository<C, Long> {
    List<C> findByD(int d);

    List<C> findByF(D f); 

    List<C> findByDContaining(int d);
    
    List<C> findByGContaining(int g);



}

```

my api controller file looks like this:
`CController.java`:
```
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/c")
public class CController {

    @Autowired
    private CRepo cRepo; 
    

    @GetMapping("/a")
    public List<C> a() {
        return cRepo.findByGContaining(1);
    }


}
```

when i run spring and access http://localhost:8085/api/c/a, i get this error:
```
2023-08-09 22:53:02.894 ERROR 14326 --- [nio-8085-exec-1] o.a.c.c.C.[.[.[/].[dispatcherServlet]    : Servlet.service() for servlet [dispatcherServlet] in context with path [] threw exception [Request processing failed; nested exception is org.springframework.dao.InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException: Parameter value [%1%] did not match expected type [java.lang.Integer (n/a)]; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Parameter value [%1%] did not match expected type [java.lang.Integer (n/a)]] with root cause
```

how to fix?

# A1

The error you are encountering is caused by the `findByGContaining` method in your repository interface. The `findByGContaining` method should be used for searching strings, as it's meant for "contains" searches on string attributes. In your case, it's being used on an integer attribute, which is causing the error.

Since you're trying to find records with a specific value for the `g` attribute, you should use the appropriate method for exact equality:

```java
@Repository
public interface CRepo extends JpaRepository<C, Long> {
    List<C> findByD(int d);

    List<C> findByF(D f);

    List<C> findByG(int g); // Use findByG instead of findByGContaining
}
```

In your `CController` class, you are calling `cRepo.findByGContaining(1)`. Instead, you should call `cRepo.findByG(1)`:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/c")
public class CController {

    @Autowired
    private CRepo cRepo;

    @GetMapping("/a")
    public List<C> a() {
        return cRepo.findByG(1); // Use findByG instead of findByGContaining
    }
}
```

This change ensures that you are using the correct method to search for records with a specific integer value for the `g` attribute. The `findByG` method is used for exact equality searches on integer attributes, while `findByGContaining` is used for searching string attributes for partial matches.

After making these changes, accessing http://localhost:8085/api/c/a should work without errors, assuming your database contains records with the `g` attribute set to 1.


# Q2


thank you, it works now. could you provide me a link that states that `containing` requires searching for strings

# A2

I apologize for any confusion, but there might be a misunderstanding. In Spring Data JPA, the `Containing` keyword is used to perform substring searches on string attributes, but it doesn't require searching for strings exclusively. The `Containing` keyword can be used with string attributes to find records where the attribute contains a specific substring. It doesn't necessarily apply to integer attributes.

Here's the clarification:

The `Containing` keyword is not specifically for searching strings; it's for substring matching on string attributes. It's not intended for searching integer attributes or performing exact equality checks.

In your original code, you were using `findByGContaining(1)`, which was incorrect because `Containing` is not suitable for searching integer attributes like `g`.

If you want to find records where the `g` attribute has an exact integer value, you should use `findByG(int g)` as I mentioned earlier.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021, Spring Data JPA doesn't provide a direct keyword like `Containing` for performing substring-like searches on integer attributes.

For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend referring to the official Spring Data JPA documentation:

Spring Data JPA Reference Documentation:
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#reference

In the documentation, you can explore various query methods and keywords available in Spring Data JPA, including how to use them properly for different scenarios.

# Q3

why does `Containing` only work for string attributes and not integer attributes? does it have something to do with the specific SQL command that `Containing` refers to? for reference, i am using SQLite. also, what are string attributes and integer attributes?

# A3

The `Containing` keyword in Spring Data JPA is specifically designed for performing substring searches on string attributes. It is not designed to work with integer attributes because it's based on the concept of searching within a string for a specific substring.

The way substring searches work is fundamentally different from equality checks or range queries that are typically performed on numeric (integer) attributes. When you use `Containing` with a string attribute, Spring Data JPA generates SQL queries that use the `LIKE` operator to search for a specific substring within the string attribute. This is a concept that is applicable and meaningful for string data types but not for numeric data types like integers.

For example, if you have a `name` attribute that is a string, you might use `Containing` to find all records where the name contains a specific substring:

```java
List<Person> findByNameContaining(String substring);
```

However, when it comes to integers, a substring search is not relevant. Integers are typically used for exact equality checks or range queries (greater than, less than, etc.), which involve different SQL operations.

Regarding your question about string attributes and integer attributes:

- **String Attributes:** In the context of Spring Data JPA, a string attribute refers to an attribute of a JPA entity that is of a string data type, such as `String` in Java. String attributes are used to store textual data, like names, descriptions, addresses, etc.

- **Integer Attributes:** An integer attribute refers to an attribute of a JPA entity that is of an integer data type, such as `int` or `Integer` in Java. Integer attributes are used to store whole number values, like IDs, counts, ages, etc.

In summary, `Containing` is tailored for substring searches on string attributes and does not apply to integer attributes due to the different nature of the data and the operations typically performed on them. If you need to perform searches on integer attributes, you would typically use equality checks (`findByX(int x)`) or range queries (`findByXBetween(int min, int max)`) based on the specific use case.


# Q4

does the SQL`LIKE` operator search for a substring? if so, does it only work on strings and not integers?

# A4

Yes, the SQL `LIKE` operator is used to perform substring searches within string values in a database column. It allows you to search for a specified pattern within a string. The `LIKE` operator is often used with wildcard characters such as `%` (matches any sequence of characters) and `_` (matches any single character).

For example, if you have a column `name` and you want to find all records where the name contains the substring "john", you could use the `LIKE` operator like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE name LIKE '%john%';
```

This would return all rows where the `name` column contains the substring "john".

The `LIKE` operator is specific to string data types. It does not work on numeric data types like integers, because the concept of substring matching is not meaningful for numeric values. Numeric values are typically compared for equality, inequality, or within specific ranges, which are different types of operations.

In the context of Spring Data JPA, when you use `Containing` with a string attribute, Spring Data JPA translates this into an appropriate SQL query that uses the `LIKE` operator to perform a substring search on that attribute. This is why `Containing` is relevant only for string attributes and not for integer attributes.

To search for specific integer values or ranges, you would use other query methods in Spring Data JPA that are appropriate for those types of searches, such as equality checks (`findByX(int x)`) or range queries (`findByXBetween(int min, int max)`). These methods would generate SQL queries that use equality (`=`) or comparison (`BETWEEN`) operations rather than the `LIKE` operator.


# Q5

please convert  `List<C> findByGContaining(String g);` into the respective SQL query

# A5

The `findByGContaining(String g)` method would be used to search for records where the `g` attribute (which appears to be an integer) contains a specific substring represented as a string `g`.

However, using `Containing` for an integer attribute might not make sense, as I explained earlier, because `Containing` is meant for substring searches in string attributes. For integer attributes, you would typically use exact equality checks (`findByG(int g)`).

But if you still want to understand how a `Containing` query might be converted to an SQL query for string attributes, here's how it might look:

Assuming you have a `name` string attribute and you want to find records where the `name` contains the substring "John":

```java
List<Person> findByNameContaining(String name);
```

The generated SQL query might look something like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE name LIKE '%John%';
```

This SQL query searches the `name` column for records containing the substring "John".

Again, please note that the concept of substring matching and the use of `Containing` are specific to string attributes. It's important to use appropriate query methods (`findByG(int g)`) for integer attributes to perform meaningful searches.


# Q6

i changed  the pojo in `C.java` to `private String g`.  please convert  `List<C> findByGContaining(String g);` into the respective SQL query

# A6
I apologize for any confusion earlier. If you have changed the `g` attribute in the `C` class to be a string (as `private String g`), then using `Containing` makes sense for substring searches within the `g` attribute. Here's how the method `List<C> findByGContaining(String g)` would translate into the respective SQL query:

Assuming you have the following method in your repository:

```java
List<C> findByGContaining(String g);
```

And assuming the `g` attribute is now a string, the generated SQL query might look something like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM c WHERE g LIKE '%substring%';
```

In this case, the `%substring%` represents the input value you provide to the `findByGContaining` method. This SQL query will search the `g` column for records containing the specified substring.

Just a reminder that the `Containing` keyword and substring matching are specifically designed for string attributes. If you're working with integer attributes, you would typically use other query methods like equality checks (`findByG(int g)`) or range queries (`findByGBetween(int min, int max)`), as mentioned earlier.

# Q7

one thing i don't understand is that if i were to hypothetically do `List<C> findByGContaining(String g);` with `C.java` having `private int g`, wouldn't `List<C> findByGContaining(String g);` be translated to something like `SELECT * FROM c WHERE g LIKE '%1%'` in SQL?  since SQL does implicit conversion, wouldn't '%1%' be converted to integer and work successfully? but why does it not work? 

# A7

You're correct that some databases, like MySQL, can perform implicit type conversion in certain cases. However, the behavior of implicit type conversion and how it's handled can vary between different databases and even specific database configurations.

In the case of Spring Data JPA, it's designed to work across multiple databases, and it aims to provide consistent behavior regardless of the underlying database system. As a result, Spring Data JPA doesn't rely on implicit type conversion for query parameters.

When you use `findByGContaining(String g)` with an integer attribute in Spring Data JPA, it expects the parameter `g` to be a string, and it performs a substring search on the string representation of the `g` attribute in the database. The `%1%` in the query string is treated as a string literal, not as an integer that needs to be converted.

So, even if certain databases might allow implicit type conversion in some cases, Spring Data JPA intentionally handles query parameters in a consistent way, treating them as the specified data type (in this case, a string). This is done to provide predictable and reliable behavior across different database systems.

If you want to perform a substring search on an integer attribute, you would need to explicitly convert the integer to a string before passing it as a parameter to the query method, like this:

```java
List<C> findByGContaining(String g);
```

And then when you call this method, you would pass the integer value converted to a string:

```java
List<C> results = cRepo.findByGContaining(String.valueOf(1));
```

This way, you ensure that you're working with strings consistently, regardless of the underlying database behavior.

# Q8

could you provide me a link that states that spring data jpa does not do implicit type conversion for query parameters? 

# A8

I apologize for any confusion, but there isn't a specific link that states Spring Data JPA's behavior regarding implicit type conversion for query parameters. The behavior I described is based on my knowledge of Spring Data JPA and how it's designed to provide consistent behavior across different database systems.

Spring Data JPA aims to abstract away database-specific details and provide a unified API for interacting with various databases. It doesn't rely on database-specific features like implicit type conversion, as it would lead to inconsistent behavior across different databases.

If you're looking for specific documentation regarding implicit type conversion in Spring Data JPA, it's best to consult the official Spring Data JPA documentation. While the documentation may not explicitly cover the topic of implicit type conversion, it provides comprehensive information on query methods, query creation, and supported query keywords.

Here is the official Spring Data JPA documentation where you can find detailed information about query methods and query creation:

Spring Data JPA Reference Documentation:
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#reference

If you have specific questions about how Spring Data JPA handles query parameters, type conversion, or any other aspect of JPA, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to provide accurate information based on my knowledge and experience.
