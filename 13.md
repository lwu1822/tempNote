# Q1 


the jpa documentation for `findByXContaining` defines the JPQL snippet as `where x.firstname like ?1 (parameter bound wrapped in %)`. what does `?1` mean and what does "parameter bound wrapped in %" mean? 

# A1

In the context of Spring Data JPA, `findByXContaining` is a query creation mechanism that generates a query to retrieve records based on a substring contained within a specific attribute (`X` in your case). Let's break down the terms you mentioned:

1. `?1`: This is a positional parameter placeholder in JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) or SQL. In Spring Data JPA, when you use query methods with the `findByXContaining` pattern, the framework automatically constructs a query based on the method name and any method parameters. The `?1` placeholder represents the first parameter that you pass to the method.

2. "Parameter bound wrapped in %": This refers to the automatic inclusion of the `%` wildcard characters around the parameter value you pass to the method. In a `findByXContaining` query, Spring Data JPA wraps the parameter value with `%` characters to create a substring search. This means that you only need to provide the actual substring you want to search for, and Spring Data JPA takes care of adding the `%` wildcards.

For example, if you have a query method like this:

```java
List<Person> findByFirstNameContaining(String substring);
```

And you call this method with `"John"` as the parameter:

```java
List<Person> results = personRepository.findByFirstNameContaining("John");
```

Spring Data JPA will automatically generate a query similar to this:

```sql
SELECT p FROM Person p WHERE p.firstName LIKE '%John%'
```

The `%` characters are added by Spring Data JPA around the `"John"` parameter you passed, creating a query that searches for records where the `firstName` attribute contains the substring "John".

So, in summary:

- `?1` is a placeholder for the first parameter in the method call.
- "Parameter bound wrapped in %" means that the actual parameter value you pass is surrounded by `%` characters to create a substring search.
