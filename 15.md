# Q1 

if electric field vector is tangent to electric field line, how is the electric field vector and electric field line pointing in the same direction? shouldn't they be perpendicular to each other?

# A1

The electric field vector and electric field lines are related but distinct concepts. Let's clarify their relationship and how they are represented.

1. **Electric Field Vector:**
   - The electric field (\( \mathbf{E} \)) at a point is represented by a vector. This vector points in the direction of the force experienced by a positive test charge placed at that point.
   - The magnitude of the electric field vector indicates the strength of the electric field at that point.

2. **Electric Field Lines:**
   - Electric field lines are imaginary lines that represent the direction a positive test charge would follow if placed at any point in the field.
   - The tangent to an electric field line at any point gives the direction of the electric field at that point.

Now, if the electric field vector is tangent to the electric field line, it means that at that particular point, the direction of the electric field vector coincides with the direction of the electric field line.

The confusion may arise from the fact that, in diagrams, electric field lines are often drawn to represent the overall pattern of the electric field in a region. The lines are drawn such that they point in the direction of the electric field at each point along the line. Thus, if you draw the electric field vector at any point on an electric field line, it will be tangent to that line, indicating the direction of the field at that specific point.

In summary, at any given point, the electric field vector and the electric field line are indeed pointing in the same direction because the electric field line is constructed to represent the direction of the electric field at each point along the line.


# Q2

what does tangent mean?

# A2

In geometry, the term "tangent" refers to a line or plane that touches a curve or surface at a single point, without crossing through it. The point where the tangent touches the curve or surface is called the point of tangency.

In the context of electric field lines, when we say that the electric field vector is tangent to the electric field line at a particular point, we mean that the vector points in the same direction as the electric field line at that specific point, and it touches the line at that point without crossing through it. The tangent vector represents the direction of the electric field at the chosen location along the field line.
