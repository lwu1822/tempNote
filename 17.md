# Q1

is the supertonic seventh chord or half diminished supertonic seventh chord more dissonant

# A1

The half-diminished supertonic seventh chord (also known as the minor seventh flat five chord) is generally considered more dissonant than the regular supertonic seventh chord (minor seventh chord).

In a half-diminished supertonic seventh chord, the combination of a minor third, diminished fifth, and minor seventh creates a dissonant sound. The tension between these intervals contributes to the chord's dissonant quality.

On the other hand, the regular supertonic seventh chord includes a minor third, perfect fifth, and minor seventh. While it has some dissonance due to the minor seventh, it is generally less dissonant compared to the half-diminished version.

In summary, if you're comparing the two, the half-diminished supertonic seventh chord is typically considered more dissonant.


# Q2

is it because diminished fifth is more dissonant than perfect fifth? that's the only difference in intervals between half diminished supertonic seventh chord and regular supertonic seventh chord

# A2

Yes, that's correct. The increased dissonance in the half-diminished supertonic seventh chord compared to the regular supertonic seventh chord is primarily due to the presence of a diminished fifth (or augmented fourth) interval in the former.

The diminished fifth interval is considered more dissonant than the perfect fifth interval. The tension created by the diminished fifth contributes to the overall dissonant and unsettled quality of the half-diminished chord. The regular supertonic seventh chord, lacking the diminished fifth, is relatively less dissonant in comparison.
