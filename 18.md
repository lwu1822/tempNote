# Q1 
what does the phrase "not at all the more" mean in english

# A1

The phrase "not at all the more" is used to emphasize that there has been no increase or enhancement in a particular quality or inclination. It suggests a lack of change or influence in a specific direction. In the context of the quote from "Frankenstein" where Victor Frankenstein says, "But I returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape," it means that his inclination or desire to pursue the scientific studies mentioned has not increased; if anything, it may have decreased or remained unchanged.


# Q2

why is there a "but" in the sentence "I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape."

# A2

The use of "but" in this sentence serves to contrast or qualify the statement that precedes it. Let's break down the sentence for clarity:

"I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape."

1. "I returned home not disappointed": This part establishes that the speaker was not disappointed upon returning home.

2. "for I have said that I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated": This provides a reason for the lack of disappointment. The speaker had already held the view that the authors criticized by the professor were useless, so the professor's disapproval didn't affect the speaker negatively.

3. "but I returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape": The use of "but" introduces a contrast. Despite not being disappointed and despite already holding a negative opinion about the mentioned studies, the speaker emphasizes that their inclination to engage in those studies did not increase. The use of "not at all the more" reinforces that there was no heightened interest or desire to pursue those studies further.

In summary, the "but" is used to highlight a contrast between the lack of disappointment and the unchanged or diminished inclination to pursue the criticized studies.


# Q3

how is there a contrast between the lack of disappointment and the unchanged or diminished inclination to pursue the criticized studies?

# A3 

The contrast in the sentence arises from the conjunction "but," signaling a shift in focus or perspective. Let's break it down:

1. "I returned home not disappointed": This part establishes the speaker's initial emotional stateâ€”there was no disappointment upon returning home.

2. "but I returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape": The use of "but" introduces a contrast with the lack of disappointment. The speaker is emphasizing that despite not feeling disappointed, there was no increase in inclination or desire to engage in the studies that were criticized by the professor. This suggests a lack of positive impact or change in the speaker's attitude toward those studies.

The contrast lies in the fact that one might expect a positive outcome or change in inclination after not experiencing disappointment. However, the speaker clarifies that, in this case, the lack of disappointment did not lead to an increased desire to pursue the criticized studies. The "but" signals a nuanced response, highlighting that emotional neutrality (not being disappointed) doesn't necessarily translate into a positive shift in attitude toward the studies in question.
