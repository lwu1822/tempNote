# Q1

why does the situation above give a "could not autowire" error while a regular java code with two classes would compile successfully, like this:

Test2.java:
```
package com.noteForNow;

public class Test2 {
    public int a;

    public Test2(int a) {
        this.a = a;
    }
   
}
```

Test.java:
```
package com.noteForNow;


public class Test {

    public Test2 testing;

    public Test(Test2 testing) {
        this.testing = testing;
    }


    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test2 b = new Test2(1);

        Test c = new Test(b);

        System.out.println(c.testing.a);

        System.out.println(b.a);
    }
}
```


# A1

In the example you provided, you have a simple Java code without any Spring annotations or dependency injection. In this case, you are manually creating instances of the `Test2` and `Test` classes in the `main` method and passing the `Test2` instance to the `Test` constructor. This manual instantiation and dependency injection are entirely handled by your code, and there is no involvement of Spring's IoC container.

In regular Java code like this, there is no automatic component scanning or bean instantiation, which is typical in Spring applications. Instead, you explicitly create objects and establish dependencies between them using constructor or method parameters.

When you run this regular Java code, it compiles and executes successfully because you are taking care of all the object creation and wiring manually. The Java compiler checks the syntax and the type of objects and variables used, but it does not perform any kind of dependency injection or bean resolution like Spring does.

On the other hand, in a Spring application with annotations and dependency injection, Spring's IoC container is responsible for managing the objects (beans) and injecting dependencies between them. The error "Could not autowire. No beans of `TestService` type found" occurs when Spring's IoC container is unable to find a suitable bean for autowiring, either because the bean is not annotated correctly or it is not defined in the application context.

In summary, the two examples you provided are different in nature. The first one involves a Spring application with annotations and dependency injection, and the second one is a regular Java code without any Spring features. Consequently, the behavior and error handling are distinct in each case.


# Q2

was it also because TestApiController.java had `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping("/api/test")`? because when i comment out those two lines and also comment out `@Component` in TestService.java, the Spring Boot project compiles fine


# A2

Yes, you are correct. The presence of `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping` annotations in `TestApiController.java` could be the reason why you didn't encounter the "Could not autowire. No beans of `TestService` type found" error when `@Component` was commented out in `TestService.java`.

When you use the `@RestController` annotation on a class, it is effectively equivalent to using both `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody` annotations. It tells Spring that the class is a controller, and the methods in this class will handle incoming HTTP requests and return the response directly in the response body (as opposed to rendering a view). Additionally, `@RestController` implicitly applies `@ResponseBody` to all its methods, which means the return values of these methods will be serialized and sent as the response body.

The combination of `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping` effectively exposes the methods in the `TestApiController` class as RESTful endpoints. However, without the `@Component` annotation on the `TestService` class, `TestService` will not be treated as a Spring bean, and hence you would expect the "Could not autowire. No beans of `TestService` type found" error.

The fact that you did not encounter the error when you commented out `@Component` in `TestService.java` might be due to the following reasons:

1. You commented out `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping` in `TestApiController.java`, which means the class and its methods are no longer exposed as RESTful endpoints. As a result, Spring might not attempt to resolve the dependencies for this controller (including the `TestService` dependency) during startup.

2. If you are running a Spring Boot application, certain auto-configuration mechanisms might handle specific scenarios more gracefully. In some cases, if a bean is not found during startup and is not required for the basic functioning of the application, Spring Boot might tolerate the missing dependency and allow the application to start without an error. However, this behavior may not be consistent and could depend on other factors and configurations in your project.

In any case, it's important to ensure that your application's dependencies are properly defined and wired to avoid potential runtime issues. If you intend to use `TestService` as a dependency in `TestApiController`, it's recommended to annotate it with `@Component` (or one of its specific stereotype annotations like `@Service`, `@Repository`, etc.) to make it a Spring bean explicitly. This way, Spring will manage the lifecycle of the bean and handle its dependencies correctly.



# Q3

what does resolving dependencies mean when you say "As a result, Spring might not attempt to resolve the dependencies for this controller (including the TestService dependency) during startup."


# A3

Resolving dependencies in the context of Spring and dependency injection means that Spring is responsible for finding and providing the necessary dependencies (objects) to a class when it is being instantiated. In other words, when a class has dependencies on other classes, Spring will identify those dependencies and automatically inject the appropriate instances into the class when it is created.

In the case of Spring MVC controllers, like the `TestApiController` class in your example, these controllers often depend on other classes, such as service classes or repositories, to perform their intended operations. For example, the `TestApiController` might need a `TestService` instance to handle certain business logic.

When you use the `@Autowired` annotation (or constructor-based injection) on a field or constructor in the controller class, you are telling Spring to automatically resolve and inject the required dependency, in this case, the `TestService` bean. Here's an example using `@Autowired`:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/testing")
public class TestApiController {
  
    private TestService testService;

    @Autowired
    public TestApiController(TestService testService) {
        this.testService = testService;
    }

    // Rest of the controller code that uses testService
}
```

In this example, the `TestService` bean will be automatically injected into the `TestApiController` when it is created, allowing the controller to access and utilize the functionality provided by the `TestService`.

However, if the `TestService` class is not a Spring bean (i.e., it is not annotated with `@Component` or any of its stereotype annotations), Spring won't be able to find the `TestService` bean during its component scanning process. As a result, when it comes to creating the `TestApiController`, Spring won't be able to resolve the dependency for the `TestService`, and you would encounter the "Could not autowire. No beans of `TestService` type found" error.

To summarize, resolving dependencies in the context of Spring means providing the necessary beans to a class that requires them. If a required bean is not found or not defined properly, Spring won't be able to resolve the dependency, and you may encounter errors during application startup or runtime.


# Q4


is resolving dependencies the same thing as dependency injection


# A4

Yes, resolving dependencies is the same thing as dependency injection in the context of Spring and other Inversion of Control (IoC) containers.

Dependency injection is a design pattern used to achieve loose coupling between classes and to promote the reusability and testability of code. In this pattern, a class does not create its dependencies directly but instead receives them from an external source, typically a container like Spring's IoC container.

When a class depends on other classes or services to perform its tasks, it needs access to instances of those classes. Dependency injection allows the container to "inject" or provide these dependent objects to the class at runtime, rather than the class creating them itself. This way, the class relies on the container to fulfill its dependencies, and it remains unaware of how and where those dependencies are created.

Resolving dependencies, therefore, refers to the process of providing the necessary objects (dependencies) to a class that requires them through dependency injection. The container (e.g., Spring) takes responsibility for locating the appropriate beans (instances) and wiring them together to establish the dependencies between different classes.

In Spring, there are various ways to perform dependency injection, including constructor injection, setter injection, and field injection, with constructor injection being the preferred approach for many cases due to its advantages in terms of immutability and clearer requirements for mandatory dependencies.

So, to sum it up, resolving dependencies and dependency injection are synonymous terms used to describe the process of providing dependent objects to a class from an external source, typically managed by a container like Spring.


# Q5

does spring do dependency injection on all declarations (even those without an annotation) or only for declarations that have a certain annotation. i think it's only for declarations with a certain annotation because if i don't have `@RestController` in TestApiController.java, i do not have the "could not autowire" error (TestService.java does not have `@Component`), but if i have `@RestController`, i would have the "could not autowire" error

# A5


You are correct. In Spring, dependency injection is typically performed on declarations that have certain annotations. Spring's IoC container relies on these annotations to identify which classes should be treated as beans and manage their dependencies.

By default, Spring's component scanning mechanism looks for classes annotated with specific stereotype annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller`. When a class is annotated with one of these annotations, Spring registers it as a bean in the application context, and its dependencies can be automatically resolved and injected.

In your specific scenario:

1. When you don't have `@RestController` in `TestApiController.java`, Spring treats it as a regular Java class and does not consider it a Spring-managed bean. Since `TestApiController` is not a Spring bean, there's no attempt by Spring to perform dependency injection for this class, and hence, you don't encounter the "could not autowire" error related to `TestService`.

2. However, when you add `@RestController` to `TestApiController.java`, Spring now recognizes it as a controller and automatically attempts to manage it as a bean. If `TestService` is not annotated as a bean (e.g., with `@Component`), Spring won't find a matching bean for dependency injection, leading to the "could not autowire" error.

The `@RestController` annotation itself does not trigger dependency injection, but it signals to Spring that the class is a controller and should be considered for auto-detection and management as a bean.

To resolve the "could not autowire" error in this scenario, you need to annotate `TestService` with `@Component` (or one of the appropriate stereotype annotations) so that it becomes a Spring bean and can be automatically injected into `TestApiController`.


# Q6

when you say "The @RestController annotation itself does not trigger dependency injection", what would trigger dependency injection? is it `@Autowired`?

# A6

Yes, you are correct. The `@Autowired` annotation is what triggers the dependency injection in Spring.

When you use the `@Autowired` annotation on a field, constructor, or setter method in a Spring-managed class, it tells Spring to automatically inject (resolve and provide) the corresponding dependency at runtime.

For example, let's consider a simple scenario where you have a `TestService` bean and a `TestController` bean:

```java
@Component
public class TestService {
    // Implementation of TestService
}

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class TestController {
    private final TestService testService;

    @Autowired
    public TestController(TestService testService) {
        this.testService = testService;
    }

    // Rest of the controller code
}
```

In this case, the `TestController` class uses constructor injection with the `@Autowired` annotation to inject the `TestService` bean into its constructor. When the Spring IoC container initializes the `TestController` bean, it will automatically resolve the dependency for the `TestService` and provide an instance of it to the constructor.

The `@Autowired` annotation can also be used with fields and setter methods, as follows:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class TestController {
    @Autowired
    private TestService testService;

    // Or with a setter method
    // @Autowired
    // public void setTestService(TestService testService) {
    //     this.testService = testService;
    // }

    // Rest of the controller code
}
```

In both cases, `@Autowired` triggers the dependency injection process, and Spring takes care of resolving the dependencies and providing the appropriate beans as needed.

So, in summary, while annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller` are responsible for identifying Spring beans during component scanning, the actual injection of dependencies is performed by the `@Autowired` annotation. This allows Spring to automatically resolve dependencies between beans and wire them together without the need for explicit instantiation or manual dependency management in your code.


# Q7

when is `@Autowired` not needed because it is implicitly there?


# A7

The `@Autowired` annotation is not always needed in certain scenarios because Spring provides automatic dependency injection by default, without requiring explicit use of `@Autowired`. This is known as constructor-based autowiring or implicit autowiring.

In the following cases, you can rely on implicit autowiring, and therefore, you don't need to use `@Autowired`:

1. Constructor Injection with a Single Constructor:
   If a class has a single constructor, Spring will automatically use that constructor for dependency injection. You don't need to use `@Autowired` explicitly in this case. Here's an example:

   ```java
   @Service
   public class MyService {
       private final MyDependency myDependency;

       public MyService(MyDependency myDependency) {
           this.myDependency = myDependency;
       }

       // Rest of the service code
   }
   ```

   In this example, `MyService` has a single constructor, so Spring will automatically use it for constructor injection without requiring `@Autowired`.

2. Field Injection in Spring Boot (Since 1.4):
   In Spring Boot 1.4 and later versions, `@Autowired` is not required for field injection if you use the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation. If you have a `@Component` (or one of its specialized stereotype annotations like `@Service`, `@Repository`, etc.) and the corresponding bean in the context, Spring will automatically inject it into the field. Here's an example:

   ```java
   @Service
   public class MyService {
       @Autowired
       private MyDependency myDependency;

       // Rest of the service code
   }
   ```

   With Spring Boot's `@SpringBootApplication`, the `@Autowired` annotation on the `myDependency` field can be omitted, and Spring will still perform the field injection.

It's worth noting that while implicit autowiring can make your code more concise and less cluttered, some developers prefer to be explicit and use `@Autowired` to make the dependency injection more evident. Explicitly using `@Autowired` also provides better documentation for the code, making it easier for others to understand the dependencies at a glance.

Regardless of whether you use implicit or explicit autowiring, it's essential to be consistent in your codebase and follow the conventions and practices that your team agrees upon.
