# Q1

what are possible attributes to add in a class of User that could be used with the @Embeddable annotation so that some attributes are in a different class?


# A1

In Hibernate (an ORM framework used with JPA) and JPA (Java Persistence API), the `@Embeddable` annotation is used to specify that a class should be embedded inside another entity's table rather than having its own separate table. This allows you to create more complex entity mappings by breaking down an entity into smaller, reusable components.

When using `@Embeddable`, you can define a separate class to hold some attributes, and then include that class as a field in your main `User` entity. Here's an example of how you could use `@Embeddable`:

1. Define the `@Embeddable` class (e.g., `Address`) with some attributes that you want to store separately from the `User` entity:

```java
@Embeddable
public class Address {
    private String street;
    private String city;
    private String zipCode;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters
}
```

2. Use the `@Embedded` annotation in the `User` entity to include the `Address` class as a field:

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String username;
    private String email;

    @Embedded
    private Address address; // Embedding the Address class as a field in User

    // Constructors, getters, and setters
}
```

With this setup, when you persist a `User` object, the attributes from the `Address` class will be stored in the same table as the `User` entity.

You can add any attributes you like to the `Address` class based on your application's needs. In this example, I used `street`, `city`, and `zipCode` attributes for simplicity, but you can extend the `Address` class with any other relevant attributes, such as state, country, etc., depending on your use case.

Using `@Embeddable` can help you organize complex entities, create reusable components, and avoid repeating similar sets of attributes across multiple entities. It's particularly useful when dealing with entity hierarchies or composite keys.
